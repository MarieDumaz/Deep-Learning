# Deep Learning

This repository contains some homeworks from my class on Deep Learning.

Homework 9 is an autoencoder Neural Network built up manually using Keras. The NN is tested on the MNIST dataset.

Homework 11 is an example of the Kohonen Self Organizing Maps Neural Network manually implemented with only Numpy and math equations. It was also tested on the MNIST datset.
